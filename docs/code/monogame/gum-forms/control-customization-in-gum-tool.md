# Control Customization in Gum Tool

## Introduction

Gum Forms controls can be fully customized in Gum. Customization using the Gum tool allows immediate previewing of states.

{% hint style="warning" %}
As of April 2025 Gum Forms is undergoing a change which will simplify how styling is performed. This document is kept here for while the next version of Gum is being built.

If you would like to try the new styling, see the latest preview release on Github and read through the new [Gum Project Forms Tutorial](../tutorials/gum-project-forms-tutorial/).
{% endhint %}

## Setup

Before customizing controls you should add the default set of forms components to your project. You can check if these components exist by looking in the Components folder.

If you do not have these components you can add them by clicking Content -> Add Forms Components

## Creating New Variants

Your game may require multiple types of common components. For example, you may need to have buttons which show different colors depending on their use.

Any component can be copied and modified without changing the original.

First we can create a duplicate of an existing component:

1.  Select the button component you would like to copy. For example select Controls/ButtonStandard\


    <figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/ButtonStandard.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>ButtonStandard in Gum</p></figcaption></figure>
2.  Duplicate the component by right-clicking and selecting the Duplicate item\

3.  Enter a new name for the component, such as OrangeButton\

Now we can modify the newly-created component. Most customizations are allowed, but keep in mind that ultimately the component's states are used when your game runs to reflect the control's actions such as being clicked.

To make the button appear orange, we need to modify each of the button's states. We can do this by first selecting the instance in the button that we would like to modify. Then we need to modify the instance in every state.

Keep in mind that your component may already have variables associated with each of the states, so you may want to remove the existing variables first so that they do not conflict with the changs you are about to make. You can do this by selecting the category and pressing the X button next to all variables.

Once all variables have been removed, we can add the changes we want for each state. Select OrangeButton's BackgroundInstance. With this instance selected, select the Enabled state. Change the BackgroundInstance's color with this state selected to change the default appearance of the button.

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/08_06 47 36.gif" alt=""><figcaption><p>Change the Background to orange in the Enabled state</p></figcaption></figure>

Repeat these steps for each of the states, adjusting the color as desired. Also, be sure to modify the default state for the button. This state does not get used at runtime, but it gets used in the Gum tool. This state should probably be the same as your Enabled state, so set the backgrould color to the same values.

After you are finished, you can use this new component in any other screen or component.
